# H3 Density Visualization

This script visualizes the density of specified locations using the H3 geospatial indexing system and outputs the result as a GeoJSON file. It's perfect for mapping and analyzing spatial distribution.

## Features

- Processes location data from a CSV file to calculate density.
- Optional: Integrates a GeoJSON file to define the analysis area.
- Outputs a GeoJSON representing areas of varying density, useful for visualization in GIS software.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python packages are required:

- pandas
- h3
- numpy

These can be installed via pip:

\```bash
pip install pandas h3 numpy
\```

## Installation

1. Download the script to your project directory.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed.

## Usage

The script is run from the command line, with parameters to specify the input files and settings.

Basic usage:

\```bash
python density_visualization.py --densityfile=path/to/your/data.csv --mapfile=path/to/your/area.geojson --resolution=8
\```

Parameters:
- `--densityfile`: **Required**. Path to your CSV file containing location data with columns `LAT` and `LONG`.
- `--mapfile`: Optional. Path to a GeoJSON file defining the area of interest.
- `--resolution`: Optional. H3 resolution for analysis, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 15 (highest). Default is 8.

## Output

The script outputs a GeoJSON file named after the densityfile, suffixed with `_h3_visualization_res_[resolution]`. This file contains polygons colored based on the calculated density, suitable for visualization in any GIS platform that supports GeoJSON.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- Check that the CSV file is properly formatted, with `LAT` and `LONG` columns.
- If errors occur, verify that all required Python packages are installed.
